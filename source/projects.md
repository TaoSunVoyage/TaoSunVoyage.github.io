### COVID-19 monitoring platform

We develop a globally applicable method, integrated in an auto-updated [dashboard](https://renkulab.shinyapps.io/COVID-19-Epidemic-Forecasting/){:target="_blank"} that provides an estimate of the trend in the evolution of the number of cases and deaths from reported data of more than 200 countries and territories, as well as a seven-day forecast. The project is in close collaboration with [the Institute of Global Health, University of Geneva](https://www.unige.ch/medecine/isg/en/){:target="_blank"}.
