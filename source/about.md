Hello!

My name is Aur√©lien Bourdon and I'm a software engineer.

I currently work as a software _research_ engineer at the [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/){:target="_blank"}'s [Spirals](https://team.inria.fr/spirals/){:target="_blank"} team, where I participate in the [StoreConnect](https://github.com/StoreConnect){:target="_blank"} project. I also teach for Master degree students at the [Lille 1 University](http://www.univ-lille1.fr/){:target="_blank"}.    

Welcome to this personal website, where you can find some [thoughts](/blog) about what I love and what I would like to share with you!
