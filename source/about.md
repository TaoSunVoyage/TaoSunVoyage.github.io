As my name Tao (in Chinese: 涛) suggests, I am fated to be with *the Water*.
Born and raised up by [West Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Lake){:target="_blank"}, I spent my first 22 years in Hangzhou, the most splendid heavenly city of China.
I am now living and working by [Lac Léman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Geneva){:target="_blank"} in Lausanne, Switzerland.
